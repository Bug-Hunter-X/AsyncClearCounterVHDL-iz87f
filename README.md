This repository contains a VHDL code example demonstrating a common error related to asynchronous clear signals in counter processes. The original code lacks a proper handling mechanism for an asynchronous reset signal, which may lead to incorrect counter values. The solution demonstrates how to correctly incorporate an asynchronous reset signal to ensure proper counter functionality.
